# Spam-Ham_Classification

A machine learning model that separates spam messages from ham messages. The dataset consisted of email messages and their labels (0 for ham, 1 for spam). I have used the TF-IDF Vectorizer which gives weightage to important words and hence improves the accuracy of the model.
